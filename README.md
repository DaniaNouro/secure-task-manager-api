# Project: secure-task-manager-api

## Adding Docker Files

Docker files have been added to the project to simplify the environment setup and run the application. These files include:

- **Dockerfile**: Contains the instructions needed to build a Docker image for the application.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Used to define the various services that make up the application, including databases and other services.

### Current Issue

I am currently facing an issue while setting up the environment using Docker. At the moment, all endpoints have become unauthenticated when using any token. I am trying to resolve this issue before the deadline.

If you have any suggestions or solutions for this problem, please share them.
